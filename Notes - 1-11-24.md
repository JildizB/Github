Best Practice
Jenkins - server. This server needs access to your Private repo. Create a GitHub account named "Jenkins". Temporary token. The best practice here is to change token as often as possible (30 days)


Stages of GIT:
1. Create GitHub account 
2. Set up SSH key pair
3. HTTPS connection - token
4. Git init or Git Clone
5. Changes - Actual work
6. Add the changes - just add all the files and drectories (created/changed)
7. Commit the changes (Message)
8. Push the changes
9. Review the changes
10. Merge the changes

2 options to create a branch:
1. git branch name_of_the_branch = Just create branch
2. git checkout -b name_of_the_branch = You move while you create a branch
3. git checkout = switch branch

git push --set-upstream origin name_of_the_branch = create a branch while pushing. 
git branch/git status = to know which branch I am working on.
git push origin = only push. Cannot create a branch on GitHub

git add - you can only add files that are not epmty or directories that are not empty

NEVER use "git merge" from terminal because you miss ONE VERY IMPORTANT STEP!
Pull request = PR

Any file/folder in Linux that start with the dot - hidden
.gitignore = Any files/folder that has been listed/mentioned in this file will not be pushed. But .gitignore itself will be pushed

Use case:
1. When you have junk files (trash files)
2. Very important files - keys, secrets, passwords
3. Dublicated files = Lets say I have several similar files with small differences (several versions of the same file)
alias = shortcuts! 

Set up Alias for Mac User:

1. Start up Terminal
2. Type cd ~/ to go to your home folder
3. Type touch .bash_profile to create your new file.
4. Edit .bash_profile with your favorite editor (or you can just type open -e .bash_profile to open it in TextEdit.)
5. Type . .bash_profile to reload .bash_profile and update any alias you add.

Next alias:
ga = "git add ."
gc = "git commit"
gp = "git push"
gl = "git pull"
t = "terraform"
d = "docker"
k = "kubernetes"
