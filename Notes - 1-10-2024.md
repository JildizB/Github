Developer/Devops
Master - 35 all working on the same project

Before source control 
Only one Admin
Meerim added 1 change = A - 3 pm
Ruslana added 3 changes = B - 4 pm
Azim added 5 change = A - 5 pm
All Admin
Azim has to copy A to his C. Then again copy B to his C. 
Meerims' A will be rejected 


Using source control: 
A + B + C = all will pass to Master


Stages of Production:
1. Development/Test = When you actually build and write the code
2. Test/Stage = Where you test you code
3. Prod = Where you code applies to the main project. (Main branch)

Best Practice - NEVER work on Master branch. Code MUST be reviewed and only then Merged.

Push = From you to Internet
Pull = From Internet to you

Meerim Branch M
GitHub allows you to merge M+R 
Branch MR push to branch Master - 10%


Blocking:
Ruslana Change R
Azim  change A. Azim's work depends on Ruslana because the final result is RA

Internet outage, laptop issues - any ptoblems that prevents you from finishing the work. But mostly its development issue. 

Documentation - Also a feature of Version Control. 
1. Keep track of the changes
2. Instructions = DRY

2 types of Documentation in GitHub:
1. README.md file
2. Message while COMMIT

"Deleted the coma on line 72"
Write the message even is the changes are very small. 

PATCH - UPDATE = Critical changes to your App. 
HotFix - Quick update. Usually smaller size than UPDATE. 
BugFix - Fixing the BUG
Bug - Issue or problem in your code or app. 

If you want to check version or existence of the app = type app -v (--version)
HTTPS - Port 443. 
HTTPS in GitHub means - in order to start working on Remote repo
you need to log in from your terminal. 
Usually when you do HTTPS clone - It will ask you to log in. Provide your "username" + "password" for GitHub Wesbsite. This is for Private repo.
For Public no need to Log In into GitHub Account
If you choose HTTPS you have to log in each time when you clone. 
SSH - Port 22.
ssh-keygen = command to create 1 key pair. 

GutHub CLI - same concept as AWS CLI
CLI - Command Line Interface


Stages of GIT:
1. Create GitHub account 
2. Set up SSH key
3. HTTPS connection
4. Git init or Git Clone
5. Changes - Actual work
6. Add the changes 
7. Commint the changes
8. Push the changes
9. Review the changes
10. Merge the changes

Company is going to give you a Corporate email. 
Use this email to create new GH account. 



README.md = The default file that will be created once you create your Repo if you choose to create it.
This is the most important file in your REPO.
This file contains instructions on "How to use your CODE" and "How to navigate in your REPO"

md - Specific extexnsion related to GitHub files. Means this is the file with instructions.
Bash - .sh
Java - .java
Python - .py

HASH - Encrypted text - some random numbers and characters

If you are using GitHub website you will see 2 colors. 
Red means - Something deleted
Green means - Something added

There can be ONLY 1 Master branch and Unlimited extra branches (not Master)

Best Practice:
1. Never work on Main (Master)
2. Use SSH
3. Documentation (README, Message)
4. Proper naming of your branch
5. Keep the branches shortleaved (delete other branches after merging)

How to properly name your branch:
1. Service/application name
2. Feature - Something you add to your code - something that works (action). Reels of Instagram
3. Name of the ticket - task that has been assigned to you. 
4. Use your name



Aidana's branch has change A
Master doesn't have change A
After merging Aidana branch - It will "become master". Aidana's changes will be copied to Master
Aidana in her change A accidentally deleted 1 file. And Merged to Master.
Outcome - This file will be deleted from Master.
After merging any action/changes will be inherited to MASTER.

Who merges and reviews MASTER?
1. If it is test repo - You can do whatever you want to. 
2. Your manager
3. Your colleague 
4. Any other person who takes responsibilities for repo

git clone https://github.com/AzimAkmatov/Test-recap.git

Azim is working on A
Master has no AB has no feature to send PHOTO and VIDEO
Asel needs to work on B which depends on A PHOTO
Asel needs to copy Azim branch A so she will have AB VIDEO
